  "summary": "Frontend adds Quick Setup presets and preset propagation into the Digital Voice and IAX/DVSwitch forms, including AllStar-specific port defaulting and validation messaging. However, the diff summary does not provide evidence that the backend builtin BrandMeister directory entries were fixed to include non-empty networkLabel values, and the DigitalVoice BrandMeister server dropdown using human-readable labels is not clearly evidenced due to truncation. Several unrelated UI/content changes appear to have been made beyond the requested scope.",
