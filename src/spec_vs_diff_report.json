  "summary": "Diff adds new IAX/DVSwitch connection fields (phoneToIaxConfirmed, codecType) to the stored connection type with backward-compatible defaults on load, and begins integrating these fields into the IAX/DVSwitch connect form and saved-configuration UI. However, the diff excerpt is truncated around the connect form UI and save logic, and the saved-configuration rendering is also truncated, so multiple UI/behavior acceptance criteria cannot be confirmed from the provided evidence.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update the IAX / DVSwitch configuration form UI to use DVSwitch-style field order and English labels (Hostname, Port, Username, Password, Callsign, Node Number) while preserving load-on-mount and Save persistence.",
      "reason": "The diff shows state variables in the desired order and loading existing values on mount, but the actual rendered form field order/labels and the Save persistence behavior are not visible in the truncated snippet.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/IaxDvswitchConnectForm.tsx (truncated around UI/render and save handling)"

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Add a \"Phone to IAX connection\" checkbox and block Save with an English validation message unless checked; persist the confirmation value.",
      "reason": "State for phoneToIaxConfirmed is added and loaded from storage, but the diff excerpt does not show a checkbox labeled exactly \"Phone to IAX connection\", nor any Save-blocking/validation messaging logic tied to it, nor that it is included in the saved payload.",

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Add a \"Codec Types\" selector (ulaw/slin/adpcm) with a default selection; persist and restore the codec; show it in the Saved Configuration view.",
      "reason": "codecType is added to the connection type and defaulted/restored on load, but the diff excerpt does not show the actual selector UI labeled \"Codec Types\", nor that Save persists the chosen codec, nor that the saved-configuration UI renders the codec value (the saved tab is truncated before showing it).",

      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Extend the IAX / DVSwitch saved-configuration display to include \"Phone to IAX connection\" as Yes/No and \"Codec Types\" while continuing to mask passwords.",
      "reason": "The saved configuration tab computes phoneToIaxStatus and codecTypeDisplay and still masks passwords, but the snippet is truncated before showing whether these new fields are actually rendered in the card.",
