  "summary": "All three requested post-login transition requirements appear implemented in the provided diff: redirect is gated until profile fetch completes and is skipped during first-time onboarding (profile null), an in-app interstitial is shown while post-login profile data is still loading, and the /connect redirect uses history replacement.",

    {
      "description": "Session-scoped “one-time redirect per principal” behavior using sessionStorage (pttstar_redirected_<principal>) to prevent repeated redirects.",
