  "summary": "REQ-47 and REQ-48 appear implemented via updates to `frontend/src/index.css` (raw OKLCH component tokens and explicit dark fallbacks on `html`, `body`, and `#root`). REQ-49 is not evidenced by the provided diff summary; there is no shown change addressing potential competing global stylesheets (e.g., `frontend/index.css`). The diff also adds several new utility classes unrelated to the requested global/background fix.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-49",
      "requirement": "Eliminate any conflicting global CSS that could be reintroducing a light theme by ensuring there is no additional global stylesheet defining light `:root` tokens that overrides `frontend/src/index.css` at runtime (e.g., reconcile or remove overrides from `frontend/index.css` if it is being included in the build).",
      "reason": "The diff summary only shows changes to `frontend/src/index.css` (and metadata files). It provides no evidence of inspecting/removing/reconciling another global stylesheet (such as `frontend/index.css`) or otherwise ensuring only one active set of `--background`/`--foreground` tokens applies at runtime.",

    {
      "description": "Added custom 'radio-style' status light utility classes and shadows (`.status-light-active`, `.status-light-warning`, `.status-light-error`) that are not required for the global background fix.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest scope is limited to global/background styling correctness and fallbacks; these new utilities are additional styling features beyond that scope.",

    {
      "description": "Added additional accent utility classes (`.accent-glow`, `.accent-border`, `.accent-bg`) unrelated to ensuring `bg-background` resolves to black or providing a global fallback background.",
      "reason": "These utilities are not requested by REQ-47/48/49 and represent extra styling features.",
