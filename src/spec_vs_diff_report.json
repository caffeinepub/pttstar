  "summary": "The diff implements a global dark background on html/body/#root using Tailwind’s bg-background token and reinforces full-viewport dark coverage via AppLayout’s min-h-screen/bg-background wrapper and main bg-background. However, it also appears to change the underlying theme CSS variable palette (e.g., --background, --card, etc.), which was not explicitly requested (the request asked to apply existing tokens/classes rather than redefine them).",

      "reason": "REQ-45/46 ask to apply the existing dark theme background token globally and adjust layout/stacking; they do not request changing the theme token values/palette themselves.",
