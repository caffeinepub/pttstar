  "summary": "PTTStar: a cross-platform (phone + computer) internet-connected ham radio app that provides software-based access to multiple digital voice modes (DMR, D-Star, YSF, P25, NXDN, etc.), allowing users to select mode/host/talkgroup and use push-to-talk with callsign/ID display, without dedicated radios/hotspots or external AMBE hardware, and with license/DMR-ID compliance.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Consider adding an IAX/DVSwitch-compatible connection path (or gateway abstraction) alongside existing mode/host/talkgroup connection model.",
    "IAX/DVSwitch connection model should support additional fields (ports, node numbers, username/password) and handle credential storage securely (avoid logging; prefer secure storage/encryption if persisted).",
    "In the IAX/DVSwitch connection configuration, remove generic optional username/password fields and use explicitly labeled fields: IAX Username and IAX Password (handle credential storage securely; avoid logging; prefer secure storage/encryption if persisted).",
    "If removing the IAX/DVSwitch destination/channel field, decide whether the stored connection model should drop `destination` as well, and handle backward compatibility for any existing sessionStorage values.",
    "QRZ callsign lookup integration: decide API/access method (QRZ XML subscription vs alternative), credential handling, caching/rate-limits, and how returned callsign profile data maps into the app’s directory/user profile fields.",
    "Decide navigation impact/alternate access path if the Directory tab is removed (e.g., where saved hosts/talkgroups are managed).",
    "Define the behavior and scope of an IAX/DVSwitch “Disconnect” tab (UI-only vs also clearing sessionStorage preferred connection / backend preferred connection).",
    "Real-time TX/RX will require defining a live networking/audio pipeline (protocols per mode or via gateways), PTT state machine, latency/jitter buffering, and safe mic/speaker handling across mobile+desktop.",
    "User preference change: revert UI styling to the prior dark radio-style theme; deprioritize/remove the more colorful page styling direction.",
    "UI styling clarification: user wants pages to have a dark background, but not necessarily to make the entire app uniformly dark (retain existing app theming/accents while ensuring page backgrounds are dark)."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "Dark page body background styling change did not take effect; app still renders with a white background instead of the intended dark/black page background.",
